summary: |-
    The req library may send an unintended request when a malformed URL is provided
    in github.com/imroc/req
description: |-
    The req library is a widely used HTTP library in Go. However, it does not handle
    malformed URLs effectively. As a result, after parsing a malformed URL, the
    library may send HTTP requests to unexpected destinations, potentially leading
    to security vulnerabilities or unintended behavior in applications relying on
    this library for handling HTTP requests.

    Despite developers potentially utilizing the net/url library to parse malformed
    URLs and implement blocklists to prevent HTTP requests to listed URLs,
    inconsistencies exist between how the net/url and req libraries parse URLs.
    These discrepancies can lead to the failure of defensive strategies, resulting
    in potential security threats such as Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) and
    Remote Code Execution (RCE).
