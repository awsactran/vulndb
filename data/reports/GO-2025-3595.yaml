summary: |-
    Incorrect Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation in x/net in
    golang.org/x/net
description: |-
    The tokenizer incorrectly interprets tags with unquoted attribute values that
    end with a solidus character (/) as self-closing. When directly using Tokenizer,
    this can result in such tags incorrectly being marked as self-closing, and when
    using the Parse functions, this can result in content following such tags as
    being placed in the wrong scope during DOM construction, but only when tags are
    in foreign content (e.g. <math>, <svg>, etc contexts).
