summary: GOAUTH credential leak in cmd/go
description: |-
    Credentials provided via the new GOAUTH feature were not being properly
    segmented by domain, allowing a malicious server to request credentials they
    should not have access to. By default, unless otherwise set, this only affected
    credentials stored in the users .netrc file.
