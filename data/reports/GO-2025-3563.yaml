summary: Request smuggling due to acceptance of invalid chunked data in net/http
description: |-
    The net/http package improperly accepts a bare LF as a line terminator in
    chunked data chunk-size lines. This can permit request smuggling if a net/http
    server is used in conjunction with a server that incorrectly accepts a bare LF
    as part of a chunk-ext.
