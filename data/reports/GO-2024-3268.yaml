summary: Harbor fails to validate the user permissions when updating p2p preheat policies in github.com/goharbor/harbor
description: |-
    Harbor fails to validate the user permissions when updating p2p preheat
    policies. By sending a request to update a p2p preheat policy with an id that
    belongs to a project that the currently authenticated user doesn't have access
    to, the attacker could modify p2p preheat policies configured in other projects.
