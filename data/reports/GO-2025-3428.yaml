summary: Arbitrary code execution during build on darwin in cmd/go
description: |-
    On Darwin, building a Go module which contains CGO can trigger arbitrary code
    execution when using the Apple version of ld, due to usage of the
    @executable_path, @loader_path, or @rpath special values in a "#cgo LDFLAGS"
    directive. This issue only affected go1.24rc2.
