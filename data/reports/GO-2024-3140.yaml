summary: |-
    Grafana plugin SDK Information Leakage in
    github.com/grafana/grafana-plugin-sdk-go
description: |-
    The grafana plugin SDK bundles build metadata into the binaries it compiles;
    this metadata includes the repository URI for the plugin being built, as
    retrieved by running "git remote get-url origin".

    If credentials are included in the repository URI (for instance, to allow for
    fetching of private dependencies), the final binary will contain the full URI,
    including said credentials.
