summary: |-
    In-band key negotiation issue in AWS S3 Crypto SDK for golang in
    github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go
description: |-
    A vulnerability in the in-band key negotiation exists in the AWS S3 Crypto SDK
    for GoLang versions prior to V2. An attacker with write access to the targeted
    bucket can change the encryption algorithm of an object in the bucket, which can
    then allow them to change AES-GCM to AES-CTR. Using this in combination with a
    decryption oracle can reveal the authentication key used by AES-GCM as
    decrypting the GMAC tag leaves the authentication key recoverable as an
    algebraic equation. It is recommended to update your SDK to V2 or later, and
    re-encrypt your files.
