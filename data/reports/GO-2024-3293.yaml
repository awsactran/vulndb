summary: |-
    Full access to the host's OS file system using osfs.FS with Router.Static in
    goyave.dev/goyave/v5
description: |-
    Static file serving using router.Static and osfs.FS allows clients to access any
    file on the host file system using relative paths because the requested path is
    not sanitized and . and .. segments are accepted. The files will be returned as
    a response, provided the system user running the Go application has read access
    to the requested file.

    As a workaround, use fsutil.NewEmbed(embeddedFS) from the
    goyave.dev/goyave/v5/util/fsutil package to serve static content using
    Router.Static instead of &osfs.FS. Embedded file systems are rooted to the
    specified directory, making it impossible to navigate outside of the developers'
    intended directory.
