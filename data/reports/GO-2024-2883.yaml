summary: Denial of service via malicious preflight requests in github.com/rs/cors
description: |-
    Middleware causes a prohibitive amount of heap allocations when processing
    malicious preflight requests that include a Access-Control-Request-Headers
    (ACRH) header whose value contains many commas. This behavior can be abused by
    attackers to produce undue load on the middleware/server as an attempt to cause
    a denial of service.
