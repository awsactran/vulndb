summary: Golang FIPS OpenSSL has a Use of Uninitialized Variable vulnerability in github.com/golang-fips/openssl
description: |-
    A vulnerability was found in Golang FIPS OpenSSL. This flaw allows a malicious
    user to randomly cause an uninitialized buffer length variable with a zeroed
    buffer to be returned in FIPS mode. It may also be possible to force a false
    positive match between non-equal hashes when comparing a trusted computed hmac
    sum to an untrusted input sum if an attacker can send a zeroed buffer in place
    of a pre-computed sum. It is also possible to force a derived key to be all
    zeros instead of an unpredictable value. This may have follow-on implications
    for the Go TLS stack.
