summary: Timing sidechannel for P-256 on ppc64le in crypto/internal/nistec
description: |-
    Due to the usage of a variable time instruction in the assembly implementation
    of an internal function, a small number of bits of secret scalars are leaked on
    the ppc64le architecture. Due to the way this function is used, we do not
    believe this leakage is enough to allow recovery of the private key when P-256
    is used in any well known protocols.
