summary: Excessive number of function parameters in compiled Wasm in github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm
description: |-
    A specifically crafted Wasm file can cause the VM to consume excessive amounts
    of memory when compiling a contract. This can lead to high memory usage,
    slowdowns, potentially a crash and can poison a lock in the VM, preventing any
    further interaction with contracts.

    - Could not determine exactly which Go packages are affected, so leaving whole module as affected out of caution.
